# TimeManager
TimeManager uses your schedule and todo list to help you manage the time.

## Installation Python
If you haven't installed Python, please go to this link(https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Different versions
We have different versions depending on the type of the input file you are using. If you want to use the text file to import your schedule, you can simply use Text Version after installing Python. If you want to use your google calendar to import your schedule, there are some extra steps to do. However, the Calendar Version is more convenient to use after you setup everything.
### Text Version
After you download the files, please run the scheduler.py file

### Calendar Version
After you download the files, please run the cal.py file.
